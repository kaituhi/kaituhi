        <section class="about-kai">
            <p>I'm currently learning fullstack development (backend mostly), networking, and messing around with cli/tui stuff
                as a hobby. I'm a home student at some random CS college, so I spend most of my time studying, listening to
                music, or reading light and web novels. I'm getting into web because I want to start freelancing and meet new people.
            </p>

            <p>I've been passionate about programming since I was a kid, starting with python and linux around the age of 12.
                I also used to make music as a child, earning some money until my old laptop couldn't handle it anymore.
            </p>
            <p>After that, I spent a lot of time just reading books and doing nothing. Eventually, I got back into
                coding, exploring game dev, competitive programming, network engineering, and taking CS50. Then I
                spent another year just watching anime and picking up languages. I got bored of that, so I went back to
                programming.
            </p>
            <p>Even though I've been into tech for a while, I'm still pretty dumb, so I'm working hard to fix that by
                studying every day.</p>
