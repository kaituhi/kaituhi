        <section class="about-kai">
            <p>I'm currently learning fullstack dev (backend mostly), networking, and messing around with cli/tui stuff
                as a
                hobby. I'm a home student at some random CS college, so I spend most of my time studying, listening to
                music, or reading. I'm getting into web cause I want to make lots of money, move out of my parent's place, 
                find new friends, and take over the world.</p>
            <p>I've been into tech since I was a kid. I started with python and linux at around 12, and they're still my
                go-to tools. I also got into music when I was around 14, making some cash until my pc couldn't handle it
                anymore.</p>
            <p>After that, I spent a lot of time just reading books and doing nothing. Eventually, I got back into
                tech, exploring game dev, competitive programming, network engineering, and taking CS50 [16]. Then I
                spent another year just watching anime and learning languages. I got bored of that, so I went back to
                programming.
            </p>
            <p>Even though I've been into tech for a while, I'm still pretty dumb, so I'm working hard to fix that by
                studying every day.</p>
